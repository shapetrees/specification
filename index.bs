Introduction {#introduction}
=====================

*This section is non-normative.*

Realizing the value proposition of the Semantic Web lies in building useful and
robust applications that can interoperate over linked data. Protocols such as
[[LDP]] and [[Solid]] organize linked data graphs into resource hierarchies,
providing a foundation upon which these robust and interoperable applications
can be created.

Application interoperability depends on applications sharing semantics for
relationships and data structures.  Existing technologies fulfill portions
of those dependencies:
* [[RDF]]&apos;s foundation in unambiguous identifiers provides an infrastructure
    that allows for interoperability, but does not specifically encourage or enforce it.
* [=Shape=] languages (e.g. [[ShEx]] and [[SHACL]]) provide machine-readable,
    enforceable data structure definitions on single resources.

For applications that operate on more complex and interconnected resources,
<i>[=Shape Trees=]</i> express the layout of those resources and associate them
with their respective [=shapes=].

[=Shape trees=] marry [[RDF]] vocabularies, shapes, and resources into
"little trees" that provide machine to machine interoperability, combining them
into concepts that humans can easily comprehend, such as medical records, notes,
notebooks, calendars, and financial records.

This allows one to treat a set of related resources as a single grouping, and
apply that to a range of operations including access control, data organization,
data validation, and data migration.

While [=shape trees=] are intended to adapt to different technology platforms
that support the notion of [=containers=] and [=resources=], examples in this
specification will reflect usage in an [[LDP]] environment.

[=Shape trees=] are defined as an [=RDF=] graph structure that expresses a set
of expected behaviors by agents that work with them. This provides a sort of
type-safety of resource hierarchies called <dfn>shape tree consistency</dfn>.
These semantics CAN be implemented by a [=server-side agent=], or by a
[=client-side agent=] that implements [=shape tree=] operations as primitive
requests to a server.

[=Shape tree=] support by a [=server-side agent=] ensures [=shape tree
consistency=] by managing all manipulations of data within a resource hierarchy
(see [=managed resource=]).

## ShapeTree Support From Proxy or Client-side Library

If a server does not support [=shape trees=], some [=shape tree consistency=]
can be achieved by implementing [=shape tree=] support in the client, typically
in a library than can enforce consistency for any clients using the
library. Primitive operations by other clients not using the library may leave the
resource hierarchy in an inconsistent state.

For client-side shape tree libraries that operate by intercepting HTTP
operations, this specification serves as an API for those client
interactions. (Additionally, if [=shape tree=] support is later added to the
server, the client's execution of [=shape tree=] operations does not change.) In
the remainder of this document, [=shape tree=] operations are described in terms
of a [=client-side agent=] performing operations on a [=server-side agent=] with
support for [=shape trees=].

A proxy performing [=shape tree=] operations would be indistinguishable from
server support except that clients performing primitive operations directly on
the server (bypassing the proxy) may leave the server in an inconsistent state.

Shape Tree {#tree}
=====================

A <dfn>shape tree</dfn> is a machine-readable template describing the 
expected layout of a tree of resources in a [=container=]-based [=ecosystem=].
A [=shape tree=] expresses a tree hierarchy by containing
other [=shape trees=]. The terms used to express a [=shape tree=] are described 
using an [[RDF]] [vocabulary](shapetrees.ttl).

A <dfn>managed instance</dfn> is a resource assigned to 
and in conformance with one or more [=shape trees=] via 
a [=shape tree manager=]. The primary resource in a
[=managed instance=] is called a <dfn>managed resource</dfn>.

Every [=managed resource=] has an associated [=shape tree manager=].
A [=shape tree manager=] identifies the [=shape tree=] associated
with a [=managed resource=], and additional information needed to navigate 
nested hierarchies of managed resources. A resource becomes a 
[=managed resource=] when a [=shape tree manager=] is associated with it 
through the [[#plant-shapetree]] operation.

The <code class="vocab">st:expectsType</code> property of a [=shape tree=] 
specifies that the described [=managed resource=] be one of these three types:

<table class="data" align="left">
  <colgroup></colgroup>
  <colgroup></colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="vocab">st:Resource</code></td>
      <td>Regular RDF resource that is not a container</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="vocab">st:Container</code></td>
      <td>RDF resource that uses server-managed metadata to
      enumerate nested resources</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code class="vocab">st:NonRDFResource</code></td>
      <td>Non-RDF resource such as binaries or images</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The <code class="vocab">st:shape</code> property specifies that the 
described [=managed resource=] conforms to the stated [[ShEx]] or [[SHACL]] 
shape.

[=Shape trees=] prescribe physical hierarchies and can reference other
shape trees to form virtual hierarchies. 

For physical hierarchies, the <code class="vocab">st:contains</code>
property asserts that a [=managed resource=] is a [=container=] that
explicitly contains another [=managed resource=].

If [=shape tree=] `S1` <code class="vocab">st:contains</code> [=shape tree=] 
`S2`, `S1` describes a [=container=] that contains another [=managed resource=] 
described by `S2`. For example, in [[LDP]], `S1` describes 
an [[LDP]] [=container=] which <code class="vocab">ldp:contains</code> nested 
resources described by `S2`. [=Shape tree=] `S2` and the nested resources 
associated with it are considered to be <dfn>in-scope</dfn> of the containing 
[=shape tree=] `S1`.

A virtual hierarchy is defined by [=shape tree references=] that link to
other [=shape trees=] by the <code class="vocab">st:references</code>
property.
A <dfn>shape tree reference</dfn> 
identifies the [=shape tree=] to be referenced via 
<code class="vocab">st:referencesShapeTree</code>, and the [=shape path=] through 
which it is linked via either <code class="vocab">st:viaShapePath</code>, or
<code class="vocab">st:viaPredicate</code>.

A <dfn>shape path</dfn> is a string that defines a traversal 
of a [=shape=] schema. [[SHEXPATH]]

Assigning Shape Trees {#assigning}
=====================

## Shape Tree Manager ## {#manager}

A <dfn>shape tree manager</dfn> associates a [=managed resource=] with 
one or more [=shape trees=]. No more than one [=shape tree manager=] may be
associated with a [=managed resource=]. 

A [=shape tree manager=] includes one or more [=shape tree assignments=].

The server MUST advertise the URI of the [=shape tree manager=] for a 
given resource by responding to HTTP requests of that resource with an
included `HTTP Link` header with a `rel` value of 
`http://www.w3.org/ns/shapetrees#managedBy` and the manager resource
as the link target.

Conversely, the server MUST advertise the URI of the resource managed
by a [=shape tree manager=] by responding to HTTP requests of the
manager resource with an included `HTTP Link` header with a `rel` value of
`http://www.w3.org/ns/shapetrees#manages` and the [=managed resource=]
as the link target.

## Shape Tree Assignment ## {#assignment}

A <dfn>shape tree assignment</dfn> is used to associate a given [=shape tree=]
with a [=managed resource=]. 

[=Shape tree assignments=] identify key contextual points in a physical 
hierarchy. A <dfn>root shape tree assignment</dfn> is set by the 
[Plant Operation](#plant-shapetree), and any subsequent assignment applied
within that managed hierarchy reference it via `st:hasRootAssignment`.

If there is more than one [=shape tree assignment=] in a [=shape tree manager=], 
they must all apply to the same [=managed resource=] associated with the 
[=shape tree manager=].

Shape Tree Operations {#operations}
=====================

Working with [=shape trees=] entails using several higher-level operations --
each of which may represent one or more HTTP requests and/or pieces of
processing logic.

In regular use, a [=client-side agent=] manipulates resources on a 
[=resource server=] running a [=server-side agent=]. That [=server-side agent=] 
applies logic for [=shape tree=] validation and navigation where applicable
when processing requests from [=client-side agents=]. 

The key operations used to manage [=shape trees=] are:
* [Discover Shape Tree](#discover) - determine the [=shape tree=] linked to some [=managed resource=].
* [Plant Shape Tree](#plant-shapetree) - declare that a resource will henceforth be managed by the provided [=shape tree=].
* [Unplant Shape Tree](#unplant-shapetree) - assert that a managed resource should no longer be managed by the provided [=shape tree=].
* [Create Managed Instance](#create-managed-instance) - add a resource to a managed resource hierarchy.
* [Update Managed Instance](#update-managed-instance) - modify a resource in a managed resource hierarchy.
* [Delete Managed Instance](#delete-managed-instance) - remove a resource in a managed resource hierarchy.

These operations make use of reusable, internal algorithms defined in
[Shape Tree Algorithms](#algorithms).

[=Shape tree=] logic can be applied by [=server-side agents=]
implementing different protocols such as [[LDP]] or [[Solid]]. The operations
defined herein defer to the implementing protocol as to the appropriate
status code and composition of HTTP responses.

Note: Server-side processing of changes to [=shape tree managers=]
can support the addition and removal of multiple [=shape tree assignments=]
at once. For simplicity, this specification provides discreet client-side
operations to plant or unplant one shape tree at a time. However, it
would not be inappropriate to provide client implementations that
support requests to plant and unplant multiple shape trees for a 
given [=resource=] in a single request.

Describing Shape Trees {#descriptions}
=====================

## Shape Tree Description ## {#description}

While the RDF structure of [=shape trees=] enable machine readability, additional
context is needed to make it human-friendly. A <dfn>Shape Tree Description</dfn> 
provides a human-readable information
about a given [=shape tree=].

[=Shape tree descriptions=] are organized into [=shape tree description sets=].

## Shape Tree Description Set ## {#description-set}

[=Shape tree descriptions=] are organized into a 
<dfn>Shape Tree Description Set</dfn>.

An RDF resource containing one or more [=shape trees=] can be 
<em class="rfc2119">OPTIONALLY</em> linked to
a [=shape tree description set=] to describe the contained shape trees in 
human-readable terms.

Each [=shape tree description set=] is made up of any number of 
[=shape tree descriptions=].

SKOS constructs such as <code>skos:narrower</code> and
<code>skos:broader</code> <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em>
be used to group or organize related [=shape trees=] in a given
[=shape tree description set=]

Definitions {#definitions}
=====================
Two terms are imported from [[RDF]]:
  * <dfn>triple</dfn> -- an [RDF triple](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-triple)
  * <dfn>RDF graph</dfn> -- an [RDF graph](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#dfn-rdf-triple)
        as defined in [[RDF]].

The following terms are used throughout this specification:
  * <dfn>Client-side Agent</dfn> -- A software component interacting with a server.
        A client-side agent will typically rely on the server for shape tree 
        evaluation and/or validation, but may choose to apply it locally
        as well.
  * <dfn>Container</dfn> -- the generalized notion of a collection of resources;
        implementations of [=shape trees=] <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em> use a
        container implementation such as [[LDP]]
        ([ldp:Container](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#dfn-linked-data-platform-container),
        [ldp:BasicContainer](https://www.w3.org/TR/ldp/#dfn-linked-data-platform-basic-container),
        etc.)
  * <dfn>Ecosystem</dfn> -- a software environment with resources organized in
        some hierarchical grouping that rely on [=shape tree=] concepts to
        better organize and validate structures of data
  * <dfn>Focus Node</dfn> -- a node in an [=RDF graph=].  In
        the context of [=shape trees=], one usage is directing [=shape=] validation
        to the appropriate node in an [=RDF graph=].
  * <dfn>Managed Container</dfn> -- any [=managed resource=] that is a 
        [=container=]. A [=Managed Container=] <em class="rfc2119">MAY</em>
        be an [=Instance Root=] or hierarchically nested within the
        resource hierarchy.
  * <dfn>Non-RDF Source</dfn> -- the generalized notion of document not
        containing linked-data triples; this may include
        plain text or binary data.
  * <dfn>Resource</dfn> -- the generalized notion of document containing linked-data;
        implementations of [=shape trees=] may use a resource implementation such
        as [[LDP]] (ldp:Resource, etc.)
  * <dfn>Server-side Agent</dfn> -- A server-side software component.  Server-side
        agents that support shape trees are responsible for data validation and
        maintaining [=shape tree managers=].
  * <dfn>Shape</dfn> -- a schema definition allowing validation of an RDF
        subject.  Example specifications supporting the notion of shapes include 
        [[ShEx]] and [[SHACL]].
  * <dfn>SKOS Graph</dfn> -- an [=RDF graph=] conforming to [[skos-reference]]
        data model.  For purposes of [=shape trees=] a
        [=SKOS Graph=] is used to describe a [=shape tree=] in
        human-readable terms.
  * <dfn>Unmanaged Resource</dfn> -- any [=resource=] which does not have an associated
        [=shape tree=].
